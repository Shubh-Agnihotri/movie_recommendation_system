# movie_recommendation_system
This project builds a movie recommendation system using the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset. It involves loading and preprocessing movie data, extracting key features such as genres, keywords, cast and transforming them. By combining these features, the system generates similarity measures between movies, enabling personalized recommendations for users.
